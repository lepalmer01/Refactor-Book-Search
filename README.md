# MERN: Book Search Engine

This project is a book search engine built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save them to their account, and remove them if desired. The application was initially developed with a RESTful API and has been refactored to utilize GraphQL queries and mutations with Apollo Server.

## Deployment

The application is deployed live [here](https://refactor-book-search.onrender.com), and the GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/lepalmer01/Refactor-Book-Search).
